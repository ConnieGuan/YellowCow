# Idea 4 - ShortcutShare (Tony)
    One of the most annoying thing at UCSD is how at certain times of the day, 
    certain path on campus is very crowded. If you want to get to classes or
    certain places quickly, you often wonder if there are alternative route
    you can go through to get there.
    ShortcutShare allows user to share the shortcut route on campus that
    most people are not aware of. This will allows user to have fun and explore 
    the campus at the same time.
