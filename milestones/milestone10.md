# What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
The goal of our app is to allow users to express their creativity while creating
a sense of community and exploration. Traditional graffiti defaces public
property, so by moving it to a digital platform, it allows artists to continue
to express themselves through lawful methods.

# How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently there are platforms such as Snapchat or Instagram that also have similar features to our app.
However the limits of these platforms is that they are more geared towards simply photosharing amongst
friends, with less focus on drawing. They also do not heavily incorporate the exploration aspect
that our app does. 

# What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

Nowadays, people are using social media heavily to express their creativity. While most of the current prolific social medias focuses on humorous content, our product encourage users to appreciate specific form of creativity and be active in their local surrounding, and also discourage physical vandalism of public property at the same time. This approach will be successful in a market by giving users who wants the feeling of adventures, creativity and communities, which includes virtually everyone.

# Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?
Property owners all across the world with care. Ideally people would use this app to grafitti/tag virtual and thus keeping physical property clean and and how it's supposed to be. Also artists around the world will have an interactive platform to share their work of arts.
