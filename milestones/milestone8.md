# Paper Prototypes 2

Jorenne:

Description: My prototypes display the UI of the profiles. I made two versions for both mobile and desktop, and they both display the same content. Each profile has public graffiti and favorite graffiti. Private graffiti can only be viewed on your own profile.

Connie:

Description: This is a prototype of our "Post Graffiti" page.
The primary interaction depicted here is allowing users to
upload/take a photo. They can then open a color picker and 
select a color to draw on to the photo and make a post.

Tony:

Description:
This is a prototype for the interaction flow from map screen to list screen, and eventually to the commenting screen. This alternative design is quite different from our current app design. In this design, I attempt to connect the map view and list view of graffitis so that the app has more synergy between screen.

Chang:

Description:
The main page will have a news feed of all the other pintura's and so you can view comments that other people said. By clicking on the view comments link/button, you will be lead to a page with all the comments on it. The post page has a canvas for the images/graffiti for the user to design their pintura. The user can also choose from a list of tools available.
