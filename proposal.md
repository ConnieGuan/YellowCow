Feedback:
- @holsamoht said that this idea is "original and was constructive in spreading messages without defacing properties", which is something we believe to be beneficial.
- Because @kkomat said that we can "use geography as a strong focal point", we think that this idea creatively uses the class's theme of geographical and map-related applications.
- We spoke with @AKBarcenas about their confusion about what "digitally tagging" means. In the future, if we have enough time, we might possibly implement an AR/VR mode for viewing graffiti.
- @JustineLin brought up the issue of preventing spam and inappropriate comments, which we can discourage by including guidelines for posting content. We can also implement a banning system in which users can report other users who violate the guidelines.
- We plan to implement @alok-sm's suggestion of upvoting, with more popular graffiti being able to be seen from further away than less popular ones. We think this suggestion would make people use the app more.

Features:
- Upvoting system in which graffiti with more upvotes can be seen from longer distances than graffiti with less upvotes.
