Feedback:

- @holsamoht said that this idea is "original and was constructive in spreading messages without defacing properties", which is something we believe to be beneficial.
- Because @kkomat said that we can "use geography as a strong focal point", we think that this idea creatively uses the class's theme of geographical and map-related applications.
- We spoke with @AKBarcenas about their confusion about what "digitally tagging" means. In the future, if we have enough time, we might possibly implement an AR/VR mode for viewing graffiti.
- @JustineLin brought up the issue of preventing spam and inappropriate comments, which we can discourage by including guidelines for posting content. We can also implement a banning system in which users can report other users who violate the guidelines.
- We plan to implement @alok-sm's suggestion of upvoting, with more popular graffiti being able to be seen from further away than less popular ones. We think this suggestion would make people use the app more.

Main Features:

- Virtually tag locations, and places are marked on the map

- Filtering system that allows user to only see messages with specific hashtag.
- Options to delete or remove own graffiti.
- Automatic deletion of expired graffiti to prevent overcrowding.
- Alert/Reminder system that notify user for a new graffiti that appears nearby.
- Comment system/emoji (like facebook) that allows users to reply to a graffiti.
- (Optional) Features to post with media files such as picture, audio or video.

Programming Tasks:

At the beginning of the week we will meet to discuss our goals/tasks for that week. Then we assign people to those tasks. We will also use google sheet to keep track of our weekly tasks and assign the tasks accordingly. We plan to further split up our group into pairs for a specific coding part so that no individual person gets stuck and everyone is accounted for. This way the division of work can be fair.
